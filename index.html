                <p id="textstyle">Hello and welcome to my website. My name is Tanisha and I'm an aspiring Full Stack Developer.
            I currently attend the University of Texas' Coding Bootcamp Program. I'm currently employed in the Public Sector where
            I work with families in need to help them get back on their feet through removing barriers to their employment. Some families
            may have an education barrier or they may be in need of childcare assistance so they can look for and keep employment. I 
            have been helping families toward self-sufficiency for 6 years now. This work very rewarding, but it can also be
            very stressful. I'm seeking to learn something new and exciting; to <strong>increase</strong> my opportunities for growth in 
            an ever-expanding field. </p>

                <p id="textstyle">Somethings I enjoy doing in my spare time is spending time with my daughter, Alana and painting. I love hanging
            out with my bright and bubbly 11 year old daughter and noticing the little, constant changes in growth that she develops. 
            She has absolutely enjoyed drawing since she was a toddler and now easily draws all kinds of amazing original ideas and
            characters. My plan is to create a website for her to showcase her artwork portfolio.</p>

            <section>
                <p id="textstyle">Another favorite pastime is painting. In my earlier years, drawing and creating charcoal drawings
            was my favorite pastime. For the past five years, I have been experimenting with and enjoying oil and acrylic 
            paints. Watercolors are nice too, but I love the vibrancy of acrylic and oil paints. My subjects are either flowers, like
            peonies or roses, as well as landscapes, animals and portraits. If you would like learn more about me, please feel free to 
            contact me through my contact page. If you'd like to take a look at my work and interests, please visit my 
            portfolio page!</p>
