        <p id="textstyle">Hello! My name is Tanisha Howell and I'm an aspiring Full Stack Developer. I currently attend
          the University of Texas at Austin's Coding Bootcamp Program. I'm currently employed in the Public Sector where
          I work with families in need to help them get back on their feet through removing barriers to their
          employment. I have been helping families toward self-sufficiency for 6 years now. This work is very
          gratifying, but I have mastered the duties and have several accompliments that I'm seeking to learn something
          new and exciting. I enjoy learning and increasing my opportunities for growth. The skills and knowlege I gain
          from the Coding Bootcamp would afford me the opportuny to develop web appplications designed to assist
          lower-income families. I would also love to provide web application services to government or nonprofit
          organizations.</p>

        <p>If you'd like to take a look at my work, please visit my portfolio page. Visit my contact page to get in
          touch with me regarding contracting or employment opportunities.</p>
