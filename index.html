                <p>Hey, hey! Welcome to my website. My name is Tanisha and I'm an aspiring Full Stack Developer.
            When I'm not practicing coding, I am usually at work. I work with families in need to help them get 
            back on their feet through removing barriers to their employment. Some families my have an education barrier
            or they may be in need of childcare assistance so they can look for and keep employment. I have been 
            helping families toward self-sufficiency for 6 years now. This work very rewarding, but it can also be
            very stressful due to constantly "putting out fires" in people's lives while I'm in a deadend job. I'm
            seeking to learn something new and exciting; to <strong>increase</strong> my opportunities for growth in 
            an ever-expanding field. Job secturity is very important to me. To be able to work from home or even while on 
            vacation. (Wait...sctratch that because I'm not working while on vacation.)</p>

                <p>Somethings I enjoy doing in my spare time is spending time with my daughter, Alana and painting. I love hanging out with my bright and bubbly 11 year old daughter and 
            noticing the little, contant changes in growth that she developes. She has absolutely enjoyed drawing since she was a toddler 
            and now easily draws all kinds of amazing original ideas and characters. My plan is to create a website for her to showcase 
            her artwork in a portfolio.</p>

                <p><em>If I had more time to paint, I certainly would.</em> In my earlier years, drawing and creating charcoal drawings
            was my favorite passtime. For the past five years, I have been experimenting with and enjoying oil and acrylic 
            paints. Watercolors are nice too, but I love the vibrancy of acrylic and oil paints. My subjects are either flowers, like
            peonies or roses, as well as landscapes, animals and portraits. If you would like learn more about me, please feel free to contact me,
            please make your request through the contact page. If you'd like to take a look at my work, please visit my porfolio page!</p>
